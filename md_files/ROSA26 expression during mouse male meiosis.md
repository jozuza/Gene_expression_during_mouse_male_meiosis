**Figure 5** (Ernst et al, 2018): Gene expression dynamics during male meiosis. **a** Number of genes expressed per spermatocyte. Cells are ordered by their developmental progression during meiotic prophase until metaphase. **b** Example of genes that are negatively (*Hormad1*) or positively (*Pou5f2*) correlated with the number of genes expressed during meiotic prophase. **c** Representative images for Stage XI tubules from adult animals stained with PAS or RNA ISH for *Pou5f2* using RNAScope. Scale bar represents 50 µm; original magniﬁcation ×40. **d** Heatmap visualising the scaled, normalised expression of the top 15 marker genes per cell-type. Row and column labels correspond to the different populations of spermatocytes. Genes are labelled based on their fertility phenotype: blue: infertile or sub-fertile in males, green: infertile or sub-fertile in both males and females.
